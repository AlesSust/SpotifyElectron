## ðŸ›  Set up common project tools


### âš“ Pre-commit

Pre-commit is used for ensuring code quality before it gets commited. When you install pre-commit hooks a check will be triggered before commiting ensuring the rules specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, if the check fails the commit wont be submitted. By default pre-commit will check the linting and formatting of the code that its going to be commited.

#### 1. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements-global.txt
```

#### 2. Install pre-commits hooks

```
pre-commit install

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```
